# Capstone
This is my Senior Year Capstone Project, which I completed with a team of five. I served as the team lead, front-end developer, and designer. I conceived the idea for this project intending to create a free-access website that provides students with hard-to-find informationâ€”details that every student wishes they had before their freshman year.
