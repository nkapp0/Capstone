# Capstone
This is my Senior Year Capstone Project, I completed this with a team of 5 in which I acted as Team lead, Frontend and Design. I had came up with th idea for this project and wanted to try to create a free access website for students to get a lot of hard to find details that all students wish they knew before their freshman year.
